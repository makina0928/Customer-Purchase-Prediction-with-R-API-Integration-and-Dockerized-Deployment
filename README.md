Here’s the corrected README summary and structure based on the clarification:

## Project Overview  
This project involves building and deploying a binary classification model entirely using **R**. The dataset includes demographic and financial data (e.g., customer age, gender, and salary) and a binary purchase status (1 for purchase, 0 otherwise). The project emphasizes data science and machine learning skills, focusing on model building, evaluation, and deployment using R tools.  

Key highlights include:  
1. Building predictive models (Logistic Regression and Decision Trees) using R.  
2. Evaluating model performance with multiple metrics.  
3. Deploying the trained Logistic Regression model as a REST API using the `plumber` package.  
4. Containerizing the deployment with Docker to ensure portability and scalability.

## Key Components  

### 1. Results  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into data distributions and patterns.  
- **Model Comparison**: Performance metrics for Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.  
- **Deployment**: Steps to create, test, and containerize the REST API for serving predictions.

### 3. How to Run  

#### Prerequisites  
- R and RStudio installed locally.  
- Docker installed for containerized deployment.  

#### Steps  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install required R packages listed in `requirements.R`.  
3. Run the R scripts in `R_scripts/` for data exploration, model building, and evaluation.  
4. Navigate to `api/` and run the plumber API script locally for testing.  
   ```r
   library(plumber)
   r <- plumb("api.R")
   r$run(port = 8000)
   ```  
5. Build and run the Docker container for deployment:  
   ```bash
   docker build -t purchase-prediction-api .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 purchase-prediction-api
   ```
